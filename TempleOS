Description: TempleOS is a lightweight, independent operating system created entirely by Terry A. Davis as a personal, religious, and programming-oriented OS. It runs in 64-bit x86 architecture with a custom kernel and includes its own programming language (HolyC), integrated shell, and graphical interface. TempleOS is designed to be simple and retro-inspired, without modern OS features such as networking or multitasking. It is primarily used for experimentation, programming, and studying unconventional OS design.
