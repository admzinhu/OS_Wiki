# OS_Wiki
The purpose is very simple: we are going to store the best documentation for operational systems for all users. You can obtain it for free and add information and contribute to the project's development.

# What we are going to do
I just want to make sure everyone knows what each operating system is and how each one works. I see a lot of people struggling with this kind of thing, and this documentation is helpful for everyone.

# How it´s going to be
I will make everything easy to understand, even for those grandmas who can´t open Chrome without help.
There´s no fake info here. If it is, report me as soon as possible, for better corrections.
The goal it´s make a 100% reliable wiki for everyone, made by me and everyone which had made them contributions.

# Why i want to do this
I love technology, especially how operating systems and general hardware work. I believe that by having reliable and easy-to-understand information, we can organize ourselves and study this subject even further. I'm so restless about it that in school, I was writing down documentation for Linux distributions in my notebook during class. I wrote more about Arch Linux than Paul wrote in the Bible. So I think storing this knowledge online can help me and everyone with similar needs. And this wiki can be easy to use because we can unify every single documentation of every operational system in one place, all together.

# Enjoy this wiki, and use it with happiness! 100% free and no licenses! Knowledge it´s free for all!

# Things will be finished soon :)

# I already made:
Arch Linux documentation (25/11/2025) (English) (Take this by example)
Windows 11 (27/11/2025) (English)
