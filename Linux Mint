Description: Linux Mint is a community-driven, user-friendly Linux distribution designed to offer a stable, ready-to-use desktop operating system. It is based on Ubuntu (or Debian in the LMDE edition) and comes by default with a polished desktop environment (Cinnamon), along with easy-to-use tools for software installation, updates, and system maintenance. Linux Mint bundles a selection of free and open-source applications out-of-the-box, aiming for a balance of usability, performance, and stability. It supports a wide range of hardware (provided basic 64-bit requirements), and offers multiple desktop environments so users can choose the interface that best fits their preferences. Pelo fato de ser “pronto para uso”, é frequentemente recomendado para quem está migrando de sistemas proprietários ou busca uma distro Linux prática e estável.
