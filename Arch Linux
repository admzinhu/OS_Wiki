Description: Independent Linux distribution, created initially by Judd Vinet. Installation is done manually using only the terminal (command line). 
It is recommended for users who want to build a system completely made by themselves and highly customizable. It follows the KISS and DIY philosophies, which stand for, respectively, Keep It Simple Stupid and Do It Yourself. 
Uses Pacman as a binary package manager. It doesn't have a default desktop environment, as the installation is done from scratch via terminal, so it's up to you to decide.
