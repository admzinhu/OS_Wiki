Description: Qubes OS is a security-focused Linux distribution designed around the concept of security by compartmentalization. It runs applications in isolated virtual machines (VMs) using the Xen hypervisor to separate tasks and minimize attack surfaces. Users can create multiple templates (Fedora, Debian) for their VMs while keeping sensitive data isolated. Qubes OS is intended for advanced users who prioritize privacy, security, and control, providing a powerful but resource-demanding desktop operating system.
